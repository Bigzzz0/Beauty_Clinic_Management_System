## 2025-02-18 - Systematic Lack of Accessible Labels
**Learning:** The codebase systematically omits `aria-label` for icon-only buttons (Eye, Edit, Trash2) across critical flows (Login, Admin Dashboard). This indicates a lack of accessibility checks in the component creation process.
**Action:** Introduced accessible labels as a standard practice for all future icon-only buttons.
